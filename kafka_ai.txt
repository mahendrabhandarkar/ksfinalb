Tightly Coupled Architecture

 Kafka refers source as events [ex: Inventory, Order, Payment], Topics [Characterized event - identification of event] --
 Kafka --- Producer, Kafka, Consumer
 
 PubSub Model, Single Sendor Model -- 
 Kafka relies on another servce named ZooKeeper -- a distrbuted cordination system - to function.
 
 What is ZooKeeper --
 -- Maintaining a register of all active brokers in the cluster.
 Leader Election --
 -- Each kafka partition has a leader broker
 -- ZooKeeper facilities the selection of the leader
 
 Metadata and configuration Management
 
 Kraf concepts --- 
 
 Kafka Core Concepts -- Producers --- Consumer [update inventory database].
 
 Organizing and Scaling Orders
 
 Partitions --- Divide topics into sections.
			--- Resemble Kitchen stations
			
 Consumer Groups --- for Scalable Message Consumption
 
 Rabbing MQ follow -- Single Queue Structure [example: TV channels].
 Kafka --- Video on demand (streaming(.
 
 Flink --- Apache Flink --- 
 Kafka- is messaging system --
 Flink -- High capabilities on processing --- Used for transformation -- Used for event streaming processing.
 
 github.com // Kafka - Flink - Demo-Master --- kafka-ui
 
 Apache Flink UI --- run to view on machine
 
 To support python -- adding another library to support in flink.

 Audit Logs at Confluent
 
 Audit Logs contain information about who tried to do what, when they tried, and whether or not the system gave permission to proceed.
 Sample Audit Log:
 
 Organization Auditable Event Methods on Confluent:
 
 Let's Build a Pipeline -- How to send audit logs E2E from generation to consumption
 
 Decoupled and Asynchronous Operations
 
 Source -- Ths is going to be Variety of microservices across multiple languages and cloud providers. The number of producers would increase over time but the set it still somewhat constant.
 
 Backbone: Apache Kafka -- Acts as a powerful, highly available and durable queue for asynchronous operations: -- Message Reusabilty
 
 Destionation: Apache kafka --- Serves as the primary destination for further processing, or feeding into long-term storage solutions and ideal for contineous processing and integration with other systems.
 
 Multiple Topics -- 
 Problem #1: Metadata
 We don't know where to send it. Producer should not be sending out.
 Solution: bind userid and orgId to mark cluster destination. And we will send it there. Now we need a Router Service that reads the metadata figures out the destination and sends them there.
 
 Aspect Oriented Programming --- 
 --- Every activity of user should be audited.
 --- 
 
 Destination Cluster --- Create topics and tell customer to go and consume it.
 
 Amrapali Case --- Deleted the records and digital forensic agency. 
 
 SIM tool logs can also be send to Kafka for events. 
 
 Problem #2: Missing Metadata Problem.
 You might run into solutions where the metadata generation has failed or is delayed. As a result, while sending the logs you'ill reject as the destination is absent.
 
 Solution: Retries topic [Retry -1, Retry -2, Retry - 3].
 
 Problem #3: Redaction and Internal Logs:
 All the events produced may not be fit for consumption for the user. It may need additional filtering like removing internal users, internal IP addresses and internal audit logs.
 
 Kafka Streams:
 Sample Code
 Horizontally Scalable
 Exactly Once Processing
 
 2.5GB Heap
 
 Logstash -- Send and reads to kafka also. but it is used lots of RAM.
 
 Processor Service --- 
 
 Problem #4: How to you make sure each service is sending Audit Logs?
 Solution:
 
 Kraft -- Broker
 
 Health Check Audit Logs
 
 - The Microservice need to continuously 
 
 Maintaining the Pipeline: Metrics and Monitoring
 
 --- Source Metrics -- Message Size
 --- Processing Merics -- Events dropped per second
 --- Router Metrics -- E2E Latency
